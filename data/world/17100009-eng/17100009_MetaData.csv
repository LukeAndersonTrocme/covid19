1,"Postcensal estimates are based on the 2016 Census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (CNU) (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated Indian reserves (IEIR)) and the components of demographic growth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including (IEIR) and postcensal estimates."
2,"Quarterly population estimates: Quarter I = January 1; Quarter II = April 1; Quarter III = July 1; Quarter IV = October 1."

Estimates are final intercensal from July 1, 1971 to April 1, 2016, final postcensal for July 1, 2016, updated postcensal from October 1, 2016 to April 1, 2019 and preliminary postcensal from July 1, 2019."
